# computationally-intense-cucumber
A spot of practice for some reasons. You will probably not be interested.

# What's in the box?
A spring boot application :)

Start up, visit http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

Hopefully from there it will be self explanatory!

# Building
I assume Java 8 and maven 3.5 is installed and working.

If so, fire up `mvn clean package`

# Running
Execute the jar! 
java -jar target/cic-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

# To exit running
Ctrl+C should kill it nice and dead.
